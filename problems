			  Problems with SDCL


1.  When breaking lines, SDCL inserts the line continuation before the
whitespace, which might sometimes be a problem.  (but so did the old sdcl.)
[Fixed]

2.  Line numbers of errors and input line totals can be severly
erroneous.  (Probably due to continued lines not being added in, nor
newlines in commented continued lines.)  Investiage the treatement of
new lines in the lex box. [Fixed]

3.  Normal DCL comments (<other> to SDCL) which cause a line to be
more than 80 characters are continued as if they were normal SDCL
statements.  This is an error.  (Old SDCL also had this problem.)
[Fixed]

As an example, the following line
    this is a long line xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ! this is a comment which makes the line longer than 80 characters
is translated as 
    $ this is a long line xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ! this is a -
    comment which makes the line longer than 80 characters
Which is horribly wrong, since  DCL ingores everything after the `!'
and so doesn't continue the line.

This was fixed by recognizing the exclaimation mark, reading to the
end of the line, and returning the entire thing as a single token of
type TC_OTHER.  This required changing the lexical analyser, adding an
lexical input code and some new states to the FSM.

4.  Number of lines output is incorrect. [Fixed]

5.  `until' keyword not recognized as keyword. [Fixed]

6.  DCL Lines.  Just the concept is a problem; however, the immediate
problem is that the blanks get squashed out. [Fixed]

7.  Labels are not recognized, and are treated as <other> statements,
so SDCL statements are not recognized after labels. [Fixed, although
not all DCL labels are recognized.]
