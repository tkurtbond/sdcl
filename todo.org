* Don't produce an output file if a fatal error occurs.

* break and next should work with labels, ala Ada & VMS BASIC.

* recognize labels that begin with digits.

* unlimited length lines and tokens 

How can this be handled?  It isn't user-friendly to limit line and
token lengths.  At the moment, though, we have a fairly long token
length limit (512 characters).  Of course, DCL limits the size of a
line to about 510 characters, so we don't really have much of a
problem here.

* Better Loop stack processing

** DONE Need to report unclosed loops at end of processing.

** better wording of reporting on loop stack errors

* Improve portablity.

* add -h and usage().

* Remove -d, since it is not used.

* Sort the option descriptions in sdcl.man.

* Use SYS$EXIT on VMS with condition codes defined by the VMS MESSAGE Utility.

This would make it painful to also compile on Unix.
