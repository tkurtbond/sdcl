* Don't produce an output file if a fatal error occurs.
* break and next should work with labels, ala Ada & VMS BASIC.
* recognize labels that begin with digits.
* unlimited length lines and tokens 
How can this be handled?  It isn't user-friendly to limit line and
token lengths.  At the moment, though, we have a fairly long token
length limit (512 characters).  Of course, DCL limits the size of a
line to about 510 characters, so we don't really have much of a
problem here.
* Better Loop stack processing
** DONE Need to report unclosed loops at end of processing.
** better wording of reporting on loop stack errors
* Improve portablity.
* add -h and usage().
* Remove -d, since it is not used.
* Sort the option descriptions in sdcl.man.
* Use SYS$EXIT on VMS with condition codes defined by the VMS MESSAGE Utility.
This would make it painful to also compile on Unix.  Does it compile
on Unix currently?
* Add target to make a release.
* DONE Make label numbers restart with each file specified on the command line.
Unless outputing everything to a single file.
