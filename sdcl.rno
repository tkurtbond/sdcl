Synopsis

sdcl  [-b] [-h] [-v] [-o outfile] [input-file ...]
.S
.I -8
Description
.P
SDCL is a structured DCL preprocessor, in the tradition of
RATFOR: it adds several control structures to DCL, such as
break statement, do-while loops, the if-else statement, the
next statement, repeat loops, and while loops.

Options

-b######Do not insert DCL line continuation sequences in long
lines.  By default, SDCL inserts continuation
sequences to break long lines into seperate physical
lines for readability.

Input and Output Files
.P
If no output file is specified, each input file is processed
and written out seperately to files in the current directory.
These files have the same name as their corresponding input
file, except that `.com' is substituted for whatever followed
the last period in the input file name.  Label renumbering
starts over at at 23000 for every new output file.
.P
If an output file is specified, all the input files are
processed and all the results are written out to the specified
output file.
.P
If no input files are specified, the standard input is read.
.P
If no input files are specified and no output file is
specified, the input is taken from the standard input and the
output is written to the standard output, allowing SDCL to be
used as a filter in a pipe.
.P
Unix-style i/o redirection using "<", ">", ">>", "2>", and
"2>>".  is supported, as are VMS wildcards.

SDCL Language
.P
The BNF for SDCL is as follows; the non-terminals are in angle
brackets (<>).
.S
.LT
<program>   : <statement>
            | <program> <statement>
<statement> : if (<condition>) <statement>
            | if (<condition>) <statement> else <statement>
            | while (<condition>) <statement>
            | for (<intialize> ; <condition> ; <reinitalize>)
                  <statement>
            | do <statement> while (<condition>)
            | repeat <statement> until (<condition>)
            | repeat <statement>
            | break <integer>
            | break
            | next <integer>
            | next
            | { <program> }
            | <label>: <statement>

Notes
.P
Lines do not start with the dollar sign ($), unlike DCL.
.P
Comments start with the pound sign (_#) and extend to the end
of the line.
.P
Labels consist of a letter or underscore followed by zero or
more letters, dollar signs, digits, or underscores.
Whitespace may seperate the label from the colon, but the
colon must be on the same line as the label.  Note that in the
statement
.S
.LM +4
.LT
ds :== dir/size=all/width=(filename=40)
.EL
.LM -4
.S
the `ds :' is *NOT* a label, because the colon is part of the
`:==' token.  SDCL handles this case correctly as one
statement, not as a label followed by a statement beginning
with `=='.
.P
Note that SDCL does not recognize the DCL label `100$:'
because it starts with a digit, rather than a letter or
underscore, so any SDCL constructs that appear on that line
will not be recognized.  Such labels may still be used, but
they must not appear on the same line as an SDCL construct.
.P
The labels that SDCL uses internally consist of decimal
numbers starting with 23000.  Avoid using such labels in your
own programs.  When output is being written to multiple files
the labels will start over at 23000 with each output file.
.P
Multiple statements can be enclosed between braces ({}) to
make a compound statement.
.P
SDCL keywords and braces are only recognized as the first
word of a DCL command.  This means that, given
.S
.LM +4
.LT
wso :== write sys$output
.EL
.LM -4
.S
then
.S
.LM +4
.LT
if (c1) if (c2) wso "inside cond2 true"
.EL
.LM -4
.S
is legal, but
.S
.LM +4
.LT
if (c1) if (c2) wso "cond2 true" else wso "cond2 false"
.EL
.LM -4
.S
is not legal, because the else keyword is not recognized.
.P
It also means that
.S
.LM +4
.LT
if (cond) { wso "cond true" } else { wso "cond false" }
.EL
.LM -4
.S
is not legal because the first "}" is not recognized.
.P
(Otherwise you couldn't use keywords or braces in DCL commands
in SDCL, like write sys$output "{here!}")
.P
Multiple line <initialize> and <reinitialize> clauses in a 
for loop are legal, like this:
.S
.LM +4
.LT
for (i = 0
     s = ""; 
     i .lt. 10;
     i = i + 1
     s = s + ".")
    write sys$output "i: ", i, " s: ", s
write sys$output "at end: i: ", i, " s: ", s
.EL
.LM -4
.P
The break statement without an integer argument exits the
immediately enclosing loop.  With an integer argument of n, it
exits the n'th enclosing loop.  The integer argument MUST be
on the same line as the `break'.  (Rationale: that way the
SDCL doesn't go looking across lines and possibly finding the
integer that begins a label on the next line.)
.P
The next statement without an integer argument starts the
next iteration of the immediately enclosing loop, starting at
the test of the continuation condition for the loop, if any.
With an integer argument of n, it starts the next iteration of
the n'th enclosing loop.  The integer argument MUST be on the
same line as the `next'. (Rationale: that way the SDCL doesn't
go looking across lines and possibly finding the integer that
begins a label on the next line.)
.P
The repeat loop without an until part repeats forever.
.P
<other> statements are anything not otherwise recognized by
SDCL.  If SDCL does not recognize the first token in a
statement, that statement is assumed to be an <other>, and
tokens are output until the end of the statement (which is the
end of the logical line, taking into account backslash line
continuation).  The statement is emitted preceded by a dollar
sign ($) and with appropriate continuation lines if it is more
than 80 characters long.
.P
Lines may be continued with the backslash character (\). A
backslash followed by whitespace (blanks or tabs, possibly
including a comment after the first whitespace character) and
a newline indicates that the line is continued.  If the
whitespace is terminated by anything other than a newline, the
intervening backslash and whitespace are ignored.  Do not use
the dash (-) as the continuation character, as it doesn't mean
anything to SDCL.
.P
Inside SDCL control structures (such as the <condition> part
of a loop) the backslash continuation character need not be
used because SDCL knows to continue over lines until the end
of the structure.
.P
Statements starting with two slashes ('//') are called DCL
statements and extend to the next newline. They are output
without a preceeding dollar sign ($) and without squashing
spaces and tabs to one space.
.P
If '//' is encountered as part of an <other> statement,
everything from the '//' to the end of the line is output as
part of the <other> statment without further processing by
SDCL (without squashing spaces and tabs to one space).
.P
The special significance of characters such as the
backslash, etc., can be eliminated by preceding them with a
backslash.  If a backslash followed by a non-whitespace
character is encountered, the backslash is ignored and the
following character is treated as a normal character despite
any special meaning it may have elsewhere to SDCL.

Limitations
.S
.P
Lines are limited to 512 characters.  Tokens are limited to
512 characters.  DCL statements ('//' lines) are limited to
512 characters.  <reinitalize> sequences are limited to 512
characters.  Except for the last, these limits aren't a
serious problem, since DCL's line buffer is shorter than that.
.P
Error reporting is primitive.
.P
Only labels that start with letters or underscores and contain
only letters, underscores, dollar signs, and digits are
recognized.

Authors
.p
The original SDCL was written by Sohail Aslam, of the
University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, and is available
from the DECUS program library as VAX-143.
.p
This version was completely rewritten from scratch by Thomas
Kurt Bond, with additions and changes to the SDCL syntax.
